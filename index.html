    <p>
        In this kata, your job is to return the two distinct highest values in a list. If there're less than 2 unique <br>
        values, return as many of them, as possible.<br>
        <br>
        The result should also be ordered from highest to lowest.<br>
        <br>
        Examples:v<br>
        <br>
        [4, 10, 10, 9]  =>  [10, 9]<br>
        [1, 1, 1]  =>  [1]<br>
        []  =>  []<br>
    </p>
